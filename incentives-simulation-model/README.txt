Instructions
------------

1. Use DomainPro Designer (available from www.quandarypeak.com) to open CollabArchV6.dpp and generate (blue button with gears) language elements - .dll, bin and .dpl files 

2. Again use DomainPro Designer, but this time open Reporting.dpp. When asked, point to the .dpl file generated in the previous step. This will allow you to explore the model, or edit it for your purposes.

3. Use Domain Pro Analyst and open Reporting.dpp. Point to the .dpl file generated in step 1. Click compile. Once the model is compiled, run one of the preloaded simulations, or set up your simulation.
